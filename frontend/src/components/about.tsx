            The Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma is a fundamental concept in game theory. It
            involves two players who must decide to cooperate or betray each
            other, leading to different outcomes. Despite mutual cooperation
            being the best collective choice, the dilemma arises from the
            temptation to betray. It has real-world applications in economics
            and social science, illustrating the challenges of cooperation and
            self-interest.
